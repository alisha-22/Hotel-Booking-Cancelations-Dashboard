# Hotel Cancellation Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes hotel booking and cancellation data, providing insights into customer behavior, room status, and hotel type performance.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw hotel booking data into a visual dashboard for better understanding of:

Booking and cancellation trends

Customer types (Couple, Family, Single)

Room preferences (Desired vs Undesired)

Hotel types (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)

Monthly booking and cancellation patterns

This dashboard helps stakeholders identify patterns in cancellations and optimize strategies to reduce them.

# Tools Used

Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation

Data Visualization: Bar charts, pie charts, and interactive filters

# Dashboard Insights

Total Bookings: 40,687

Total Cancellations: 15,745

Couples had the highest number of bookings and cancellations.

Desired rooms dominate bookings, but also have high cancellations.

City Hotels received more bookings, but Resort Hotels showed relatively higher cancellation rates.

Cancellations peak around Aprilâ€“May.
